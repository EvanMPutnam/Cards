# Cards
A networked, multithreaded, apples to apples/cards against humanity type game.  


## Client
Once server is started you can connect by entering a username, a password for the room, and a client.

## Server
Boot up, you can change the password in the code. I know this is not best practice but this was only designed for myself and a couple firends.  I am most likely going to make an interface of some kind for it later but it is not a priority.

Once three players connect it takes 10 seconds before the game starts.  So make sure everybody connects by then.  


## Notes
Each player inserts their own black cards as those are client based.
The server serves the white cards to players.
